Crypto Index is a centralized infrastructure of tokenized crypto ETFs. 
The first product to launch will be Index20 (i20), a tokenized, automated index, containing all the top 20 cryptocurrencies excluding stable coin.
The index will have full backup of 100% at all given moment, display in the company websites with links to view the reserves on the blockchain itself, donâ€™t trust- verify.
Every other week we will modify the portfolio, to make sure every coin and token are holding a share of exactly 5%, no more or less, and if a token falls in or out the top 20, we will make the adjustments based on certain conditions been made to minimize risks and maximize profits.

Given the fact the transparency in a core-value for us, all activities and adjustments will be shared on the official platform every week. And to guarantee the safety of the reserves, Crypto Index will use independent staking pools and apply multi-sig feature to all company wallets.

Future products will be i50, i100 and GEMi
